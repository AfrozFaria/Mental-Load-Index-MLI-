# Mental-Load-Index-MLI-
Mental Load Index (MLI) – Interactive Tableau Visualization
This project explores university students’ Mental Load Index (MLI) by combining stress, sleep, study time, and screen time into an interactive Tableau dashboard. The visualization is designed using Munzner’s nested model and supports exploratory tasks such as comparing MLI across students, spotting overload patterns over time, and relating lifestyle factors to mental load. The repository includes the Tableau workbook, a demo link/video, and a 3–6 page report covering problem definition, data & task abstraction, design rationale, iterative user-centered refinement, and references.
